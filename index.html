        <p>Let me introduce you to Mark Hamill. No, not that one. I'm talking about the random expat I met the other day because I'm trying to make friends on this sweaty, humid island.</p>
        <p>When asked about his thoughts on the color light salmon, he responded with:
            <blockquote>I think it's a made up colour (with a u) by folks that cannot accept pink</blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>Mark Hamill once told a woman she liked anal, without any evidence thereof. He's great fun. You might like him, if you can get past his general Britishness.</p>
